    "Is it possible to design an AI algorithm that behaves similar to human players ranging from beginning to master for the simple-styled Shanghai mahjong? The data used represents training data by simulations and measures the skill expression of our agent given a starting hand. Our environment is used to guide the AI algorithm how to behave as an agent with a goal to win but with differentiating skill levels. The performance level is measured by playing alone, against other players and against oracle agents to reach the intended level of skill. Though the original standard for the AI algorithm was not met, the process of designing a purposeful mahjong environment, reward prediction algorithm, functionable agent, and monte carlo algorithm allowed for discoveries of efficiencies, and reasonable simplifications for runtime/feasibility."

    "Mahjong is an iconic multiplayer imperfect information game that has been played for nearly 2 centuries around the world, originating in China in the mid-1800s<a name=\"lang\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#langnote). One of the reasons it is so beloved by millions of players is because of the flexible rulesets, point system, complex strategies, and fun it brings to all players. However, it is a game involving very much stochasticity as each of the players try to find a winning set of 14 tiles. While there are certainly many mahjong AI algorithms like those used in online games such as Mahjong Soul and Microsoft’s Suphx, the goal is to create an optimized AI algorithm for Shanghai mahjong that is fair and behaves in a manner similar to humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to analyze training data is simply by using a trainer like those created by players such as Euophrys<a name=\"euophrys\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#euophrysnote) to scrape actual gameplay from online records (such as Mahjong Soul’s database) for different levels of play; this helps for understanding different methods of playing mahjong as well as different rulesets (Mahjong Soul’s style is called jantama/riichi mahjong). On the other hand, when designing an optimal algorithm, it is important to look into Suphx and the way deep reinforcement learning is used to formulate the best strategy.<a name=\"li\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#linote) The design approach was decided with techniques such as run-time policy adaptation, global reward prediction, and oracle guiding to reach the top 0.1% in terms of ranking on the Tenhou gaming service.<a name=\"li\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#linote) Due to the nature of the game having up to 53 tiles of the total 136 tiles being hidden at any given time.it is difficult to build a standard game tree so certain techniques such as Monte-Carlo tree search and search min-max algorithms have limited applications. The way Suphx circumvents these difficulties for jantama is through policy gradient algorithms, global reward prediction of a final reward of hypothetical future rounds via learning signals, agent based training on an oracle agent with perfect information that slowly decreases access until it becomes a normal agent, and finally, a parametric Monte-Carlo policy adaptation to improve run-time.<a name=\"li\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#linote) It is important to keep in mind that the difficulties experienced when designing an implementation for an optimal riichi mahjong AI may not be the exact same for a simplistic Shanghai mahjong ruleset, especially if the AI is more imitation/difficulty based in design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core framework of mahjong can be compartmentalized to four key considerations that can be used for structuring an AI: mahjong is a multi-agent four player game with no teams; mahjong is imperfect information so nothing about the hidden tiles or opponents’ tiles are directly known; not including the 13 starting tiles that are known, the initiate possible states, there are nearly 5 x 10128 possible hidden states in the set of all states, forming a hidden Markov model for each player; and finally, the cost-reward application for mahjong ranges completely differently depending on the game state, as a good hand very much depends on the hidden markov model in order to determine possible winning hands.<a name=\"koyamada\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#koyamadanote) This framework can be applied to both riichi and Shanghai mahjong and will serve as the fundamentals for how training data is approached and how deep reinforcement learning will be used for this particular system."

Of the two, the decision of what tiles to pick up can be made easily using simple, relatively effective heuristics derived from domain knowledge, so we decided to train an agent to decide which tiles to discard."
