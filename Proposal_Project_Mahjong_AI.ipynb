    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the _other_ proposal for that. This is the proposal description for (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your AI system. Generally RL tasks may require a huge amount of training, so extensive grid search is unlikely to be possible. However expoloring a few reasonable hyper-parameters may still be possible. \n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your AI system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "To implement our solution, we plan to use Monte Carlo methods to help train an AI to play the simplified version of Mahjong. First, we have to program this simplified version of the game. As stated in the problem statement, the objective of this game is to have a total of 4 straights or three of a kind and one pair. Each state will consist of the current hand of 13 tiles, what the opponents has tossed, and what tile has been drawn. The actions one can take is chi, pung, drawing a tile, discarding a tile, or nothing. The AI can only chi a tile if it's tossed by the player before it. The AI must draw a tile on it's turn. The AI can only discard a tile if they just drew a tile, chi, or pung. The AI can only do nothing if an opponent tossed out a tile that can't be chi or pung. The values for each action will be shown below: \n",

    "\n",
    "We believe this solution will work because this game contains a lot of uncertainty and variability, making a complete model near impossible. This rules out any model-based reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Instead, by playing the game hundreds of thousands of times, we can get closer and closer to an optimal policy to this simplified version of Mahjong. This is because as the number of simulations approaches infinity, the optimal policy gets closer and closer. \n",
